# proxy-rules

[简体中文](https://github.com/Motrans/proxy-rules/blob/main/README_zh-Hans.md)

This project is a personal network proxy rules configuration created by the author. It is designed to enable intelligent traffic routing when using network proxy services. The rules distinguish between websites directly accessible within Chinese Mainland (primarily domestic websites) and websites blocked by the Great Firewall (GFW), ensuring a smoother internet experience.  

Users can utilize proxy configuration conversion tools such as [subconverter](https://github.com/tindy2013/subconverter) to convert their existing proxy configuration files into proxy configurations based on the rules provided by this project via the **remote configuration link**.

> ⚠️ Note: The content of the remote rules may change over time, and this project is not responsible for any updates or modifications.
